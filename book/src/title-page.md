# Scylla Rust Driver
This book contains documentation for [scylla-rust-driver](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver) - a driver
for the [Scylla](https://scylladb.com) database written in Rust. 
Although optimized for Scylla, the driver is also compatible with [Apache Cassandra®](https://cassandra.apache.org/).
